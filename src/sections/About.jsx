      <p>
        I am a dedicated QA Engineer with 3 years of experience in ensuring the
        quality, reliability, and performance of web-based applications. I
        specialize in both manual and automation testing, with hands-on expertise
        in building and maintaining test automation frameworks.
      </p>

      <p>
        My experience includes designing and developing automation test scripts
        using Selenium and Java for complex insurance-based applications. I have a
        strong understanding of SDLC and STLC, and I actively contribute to
        improving test coverage, reducing defects, and optimizing testing
        processes.
      </p>

      <p>
        I have collaborated closely with cross-functional teams in Agile
        environments, participating in User Story grooming, defining acceptance
        criteria, and validating API specifications to align testing with business
        requirements.
      </p>

      <p>
        With strong proficiency in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and
        practical Java development skills, I bring a structured and analytical
        approach to problem-solving, automation design, and quality improvements.
